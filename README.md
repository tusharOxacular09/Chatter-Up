A chat application built with Node.js and Socket.IO allows for real-time, interactive communication between users over the web. This application leverages the power of WebSockets to enable seamless, instant message exchanges, making it highly responsive and efficient for live chat scenarios. Node.js serves as the backend, providing a robust and scalable environment, while Socket.IO facilitates the real-time, bidirectional event-based communication.

## Technology Stack:
Node.js: Handles server-side logic and operations.
Socket.IO: Facilitates real-time, event-based communication between clients and the server.
Express.js: Manages routing and middleware for the Node.js server.
HTML/CSS: Structures and styles the chat interface.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity and handles client-side socket communication.
